# Learning Management System
For a software engineering class, me and my group built and designed an eLearning management system.
Here, professors can create and manage courses. Students can register for and participate in classes, and submit files for assignments.
Information created here is stored in a MSSQL database. Payments are processed via Stripe.

## How to Setup:
Visit the link for the Generic_eLearning repository and download the files. <br/>
Go into appsettings.json and replace the string for CS3750Assignment1Context with a MSSQL connection string. <br/>
Go into Program.cs and replace the string for the Stripe API Key with your own stripe developer key (You can make a free account with Stripe to get one). <br/>
Create and run a database migration using Nuget Package Manager to initialize your database. <br/>
Compile and run the program, and create an account for a student and professor. <br/>

# Crown The Void
A top-down dungeon crawler game about beating up skeletons and stealing cool items from their stashes. You can play as a knight covered head to toe in armor, or as a ranger who can speed shoot with a crossbow.
Our group made this project for our game development course and certificate.
We acquired the art assets from some professionals, since none of us knew how to draw, or make music.
We hope you enjoy this game.

## How to Install:
Visit the link to the build and download the files. <br/>
Unzip UnityPlayer to the same folder that "Crown the Void.exe" is in.

# Assignment Grader
A small Windows Form app where you input the amount of students and assignments you want to grade. It can be scored out of 100. You can also rename the student.
It will then calculate the average grade and display it along side assignment scores.

## How to Setup:
Visit the link for the Assignment Grader repository and download the files. <br/>
Compile and run the program. <br/>

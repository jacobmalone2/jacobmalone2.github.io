# About Me
Hello! My name is Jacob Malone and I am a Computer Science student over at Weber State University. I have also been working in IT for the last four years. My hobbies include playing video games and tabletop games, and reading about history. I also enjoy the troubleshooting and debugging aspects of software.

# Learning Management System
For a software engineering class, me and my group built and designed an eLearning management system.
Here, professors can create and manage courses. Students can register for and participate in classes, and submit files for assignments.
Information created here is stored in a MSSQL database. Payments are processed via Stripe.

# Crown The Void
A top-down dungeon crawler game about beating up skeletons and stealing cool items from their stashes. You can play as a knight covered head to toe in armor, or as a ranger who can speed shoot with a crossbow.
Our group made this project for our game development course and certificate.
We acquired the art assets from some professionals, since none of us knew how to draw, or make music.
We hope you enjoy this game.

# Assignment Grader
A small Windows Form app where you input the amount of students and assignments you want to grade. It can be scored out of 100. You can also rename the student.
It will then calculate the average grade and display it along side assignment scores.
